## Abstract:

Recently there have been notable advancements in encoder-decoder models for 
parsing the visual appearance of mathematical formulas. These approaches
transform input formula images or handwritten stroke sequences into output 
strings (e.g., LaTeX) representing recognized symbols and their spatial
arrangement on writing lines (i.e., a Symbol Layout Tree (SLT)). These
sequential encoder-decoder models
produce state-of-the-art results but suffer from a lack of
interpretability: there is no direct mapping between image regions or handwritten strokes 
and detected
symbols and relationships. In this paper, we present the Line-of-sight with 
Graph Attention Parser (LGAP), a visual parsing model that treats recognizing
formula appearance as a graph search
problem. LGAP produces an output SLT from a Maximum  Spanning Tree (MST) over
input primitives (e.g., connected components in images, or handwritten strokes).
LGAP improves the earlier QD-GGA MST-based parser by
representing punctuation relationships more consistently 
in ground truth,  using additional context from line-of-sight graph
neighbors in visual features, and pooling convolutional features using spatial
pyramidal pooling rather than single-region average pooling. These changes
improve accuracy while preserving the interpretibility of MST-based visual
parsing.
