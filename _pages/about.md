# Ayush Kumar Shah
 -->

<!--
Graduate Research Assisstant, <br>
[Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu), New York
 -->
 üîç I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), 
 actively involved in cutting-edge research at the 
[Document and Pattern Recognition Lab (DPRL)](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/index.html),
under the guidance of [Prof. Richard Zanibbi](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/).

üí° My current focus revolves around developing a fast, interpretable visual parser for math and chemical formulas. 
I specialize in recognizing graphical notations, including complex math and
chemical formulas, across various mediums like born-digital PDFs, typeset images, and handwritten strokes. 
Exploring innovative graph attention-based task interaction techniques, I aim to 
enhance contextual information while maintaining a natural and interpretable graph representation.

üéØ The ultimate goal? Achieving competitive accuracy recognizing math and
chemical formulas, packaged in a faster and more interpretable model than traditional encoder-decoder setups.

üíª Recently, I completed ChemScraper, a molecule diagram parser, which extracts characters and graphics 
from PDF molecule images using typesetting instructions, applies simple graph transformation algorithms
to convert them into visual and then chemical graphs ‚Äî without OCR, GPU, or vectorization. 
ChemScraper's fast speed and reliable accuracy enables it
to contribute significantly in creating fine-grained annotated dataset for 
training visual parsers.

üåê **Research interests:** pattern recognition, computer vision, deep learning, and speech and natural language processing.

## News

- (Nov 14, 2023): A paper describing ChemScraper parser for molecular diagrams in
    PDF drawing instructions ('born-digital') is available on arXiv [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12161). 
    The system can also generate annotated training data for visual parsers that recognize raster images
    (i.e., pixel-based, such as PNG). A link to associated code is provided in 
    a [footnote](https://gitlab.com/dprl/graphics-extraction/-/tree/icdar2024) in the paper.
