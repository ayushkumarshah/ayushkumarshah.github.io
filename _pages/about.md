🔍 I’m a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT),
 conducting research at the
[Document and Pattern Recognition Lab (DPRL)](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/index.html),
under the mentorship of [Dr. Richard Zanibbi](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/).

💡 My work centers around designing fast, efficient, and interpretable parsers
for recognizing mathematical formulas and chemical diagrams from documents across 
multiple formats, including PDFs, typeset images, and handwritten strokes.
Through graph attention-based techniques in a multi-task learning framework, I
aim to enhance contextual information, while preserving a natural and
interpretable graph representation.

💻 **Recent Projects:**
- **Multiodal Chemical Search**: A multimodal search tool for retrieving chemical reactions, molecular structures, and associated text from scientific literature, linking visual and textual representations of chemical information.
- **ChemScraper**: A molecule diagram parser for extracting molecular graphics from PDFs.
- **MathDeck**: A math-aware search system supporting formulas & text.
