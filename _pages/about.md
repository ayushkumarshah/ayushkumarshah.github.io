<!--
Graduate Research Assisstant, <br>
[Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu), New York
 -->

I am a 3rd year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Rochester Institute of
Technology (RIT), conducting research under [Prof. Richard Zanibbi](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/)
at the [Document and Pattern Recognition Lab (DPRL), RIT](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/index.html).
Currently, I am involved in the [MathSeer project](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/mathseer/),
which is a system to make finding mathematical information easier by creating innovative search
engines, interfaces, and algorithms for extracting and recognizing visual
structure like mathematical formulas and chemical diagrams in documents.

**Research Interests**: Pattern recognition, computer vision, detection and recognition of graphical structures, deep
learning, natural language processing
