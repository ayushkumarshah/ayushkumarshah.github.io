# Ayush Kumar Shah

<!--
Graduate Research Assisstant, <br>
[Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu), New York
 -->

 üîç I‚Äôm a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT),
 conducting research at the
[Document and Pattern Recognition Lab (DPRL)](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/index.html),
under the mentorship of [Dr. Richard Zanibbi](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/).

üí° My work centers around designing fast, efficient, and interpretable parsers
for recognizing complex mathematical and chemical formulas. I explore graphical
notations across multiple formats, including PDFs, typeset images, and
handwritten strokes. Through graph attention-based techniques, I aim to enhance
how contextual information is processed, while preserving a natural and
interpretable graph representation.

üéØ My goal is to deliver high accuracy in formula recognition through models
that are not only faster but also easier to interpret than traditional
encoder-decoder architectures.

üíª Recently, I developed ChemScraper, a molecule diagram parser that extracts
characters and graphics directly from PDF molecule images. By utilizing
typesetting instructions and simple graph transformations, it generates both
visual and chemical graphs ‚Äî without the need for OCR, GPUs, or vectorization.
ChemScraper offers a practical approach to creating fine-grained, annotated
datasets for training visual parsers, and also a visual parser for parsing
molecule images (raster) directly.

üéôÔ∏è In addition to my work at DPRL, I interned at Amazon with the Alexa Speaker
Understanding team, where I focused on improving speech recognition and speaker
identification using a semi-supervised approach. This
experience enhanced my skills in solving real-world problems in speech
technologies at scale.

üåê **Research interests:** Pattern recognition, recognition of graphical structures,
computer vision, speaker understanding, large language models, multi-modal deep
learning, natural language processing.

    publication at Proceedings of the 48th International ACM 
    **SIGIR** Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, in
    [SIGIR ‚Äô25](https://https://sigir2025.dei.unipd.it/index.html), Padua,
    Italy. The system is available online at
    [ReactionMiner](https://reactionminer-demo.platform.moleculemaker.org/reaction-miner).
