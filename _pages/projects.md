- [ChemScraper](https://gitlab.com/dprl/graphics-extraction/-/tree/icdar2024)<br>
    A fast and accurate molecule diagram parser using 
    characters and graphics extracted from born-digital (vector) PDF images—without
    the need for OCR, GPU, or vectorization. It uses these outputs to create
    training data for a new approach to visual parsing of molecule diagrams in
    raster images (i.e., pixel-based formats like PNGs) using a multi-task,
    segmentation-aware convolutional neural network (CNN).
    <!-- A molecule diagram parser, which extracts characters and graphics --> 
<!-- from PDF molecule images using typesetting instructions, applies simple graph transformation algorithms -->
<!-- to convert them into visual and then chemical graphs — without OCR, GPU, or vectorization. --> 
<!-- ChemScraper's fast speed and reliable accuracy enables it -->
<!-- to contribute significantly in creating fine-grained annotated dataset for --> 
<!-- training visual parsers. -->
 
- [MathDeck](https://demo.mathdeck.org/)<br>
    A system for searching PDF documents in a portion of the ACL Anthology, incorporating 
    both formulas and text, displaying matched words and formulas in context.
    Its user-friendly interface includes formula 'chips' for easy formula creation,
    search, reuse and annotation. MathDeck supports both LaTeX and visual formula editing.

- [Math Formula Extraction](https://gitlab.com/dprl/graphics-extraction)<br>
A tool for detecting and recognizing math formulas from PDF documents using
    both PDF information (without OCR) and visual features through a multi-task
    learning framework based on ResNet-50 with line-of-sight (LOS) graph-based attention.

- [LgEval](https://gitlab.com/dprl/lgeval)<br>
A tool for graph-based evaluation of recognition results, with visualization
tools for fine-grained error analyses at the level of input primitives.

- [Guitar chord recognizer](https://github.com/ayushkumarshah/Guitar-Chords-recognition)<br>
An application that predicts the chords when the Mel spectrograms of guitar sound are fed into a CNN.

- [Nepali Plagiarism Detector (NLP)](https://github.com/ayushkumarshah/Nepali_Plagiarism_Detection)<br>
An application that detects plagiarised Devanagari text files using a self-built rule-based stemming algorithm and
Cosine similarity

- [AI Plays GTA 5: Simulating self-driving vehicles](https://github.com/ayushkumarshah/AI-Plays-GTA5)<br>
A bike-riding agent in a virtual environment (GTA5), built using CNN, used for simulating self-driving vehicles.
 
- [Sarangi: Nepali lyrics emotions extraction (NLP)](https://github.com/ayushkumarshah/sarangi)<br>
A framework that categorizes songs written in the Devanagari script into four emotions using Naive Bayes.

- [Autocar](https://github.com/ayushkumarshah/autocar/)<br>
  A self-driving car that can detect lanes, stop sign, traffic light and avoid a collision, built using Canny edge
detection, Hough transform, Haar cascade classifier, and Arduino programming.
 
- [MathMate – advanced mathematical calculator](https://github.com/ayushkumarshah/MathMate)<br>
An android app that solves different types of mathematical equations, numerical computations, and calculus
problems showing involved steps.
