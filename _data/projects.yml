- title: "Multimodal Chemical Search"
  description: "A system for searching chemical reactions, molecular structures, and text in scientific literature. It integrates text, SMILES, and reaction-based queries, linking extracted reaction details with molecular diagrams and textual descriptions. The interface provides structured reaction and molecule cards for easy navigation and retrieval, supporting chemists in literature exploration and data extraction."

- title: "ChemScraper"
  description: "A fast and accurate molecule diagram parser using characters and graphics extracted from born-digital (vector) PDF files—without the need for OCR, GPU, or vectorization. It uses these outputs to create training data for a new approach to visual parsing of molecule diagrams in raster files (i.e., pixel-based formats like PNGs) using a multi-task, segmentation-aware convolutional neural network (CNN)."
