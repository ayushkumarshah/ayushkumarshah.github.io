  content: "A revised paper on [ChemScraper](https://shahayush.com/publications/2023-11-18-chemscraper) has been published at the 18th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, [ICDAR 2024](https://icdar2024.net/), Athens, Greece -- Journal Track. The paper describes (1) a fast and accurate technique for parsing born-digital (vector) PDF images, and (2) its use to create training data for a new approach to visual parsing of molecule diagrams in raster images (i.e., pixel-based such as from PNGs). [Code](https://gitlab.com/dprl/graphics-extraction/) is available and the system is online at [ChemScraper](https://chemscraper.platform.moleculemaker.org/configuration)."
