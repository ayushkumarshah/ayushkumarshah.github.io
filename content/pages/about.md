<br>

Hello! It's me, Ayush Kumar Shah, an Artificial Intelligence enthisiast. Currently, I am active in working with global
client teams to build state-of-the-art products. I have worked in the domains of Recommendation System, Handwritten
character recognition system, waste classification system, Computer Vision Systems during my time at Fusemachines.

<br> 

 My inquisitive nature, craving for knowledge, and longing for novelty and innovation strengthen my passion to work and learn daily to increase my knowledge horizon. I am mostly into python and AI, so my blog will be a reflection of whatever new thing I learn about them. Thank you for visiting my blog. <br>

:   **Machine Learning Engineer**

Fusemachines Nepal, <br> 
Aarya Tower Bhawan, Hattisar, Nepal

<br>

∙	Nepali Intelligent Character Recognition System

A framework built by combining RNN and CNN to predict the handwritten or printed texts in both English and Nepali language in different fields of a form. Worked on building binary language classifiers and a complete prediction pipeline for texts in images of different types of forms. 

<br>

∙	Recommendation System for a subscription-based e-commerce client to increase revenue through cross-selling. Involved in data wrangling, feature extraction, model experimentation, and implementation. 
Techniques used: Item-to-Item models, (Neural) Collaborative Filtering, Factorization machines, etc. Increased revenue by 6% (large as we were serving 600k users).

<br>

∙	Automatic classification of products on the basis of various chemical attributes to optimize business decisions for products that go unsold. Worked on Boosting algorithms like Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, XGBoost, LightGBM and so on for regression and classification tasks.

<br>

∙	Involved in design, review, and refinement of content - quizzes, assignments, and projects for one of the "Foundations in AI" course offered by fuse.ai - "Mathematics for AI", which is also a preliminary course for the students who will be taking Micro Degree® in AI Program.
