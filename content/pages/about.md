Hello! Iâ€™m Ayush Kumar Shah. To talk about myself, I love football (Cristiano Ronaldo is my idol), travelling and photography. I have a great interest in Artificial Intelligence and am pursuing my career in same. 

I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Fusemachines](https://www.fusemachines.com) working with global client teams to build state-of-the-art products. I have worked in the domains of Recommendation System, Nepali Handwritten character recognition and waste classification during my time at Fusemachines.

My inquisitive nature, craving for knowledge, and longing for novelty and innovation strengthen my passion to work and learn daily to increase my knowledge horizon.

I am mostly into tech and so, my blog will be a reflection of whatever new thing I learn about tech.

Thank you for visiting my blog.
