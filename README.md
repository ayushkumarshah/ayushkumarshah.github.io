# Personal Blog [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/amitness/amitness.github.io.svg?branch=source)](https://travis-ci.org/amitness/amitness.github.io)

This repository hosts the code for my personal [blog](https://amitness.com).

The website is powered by [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/) — a static site generator written in Python — and uses a theme based on [bulrush](https://github.com/amitness/bulrush).


## Build Locally

The easiest way to do this is in a Python [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/). 

### Create a Virtual Environment

Once you have `virtualenv` installed, create a virtual environment to hold Pelican and its dependencies:

    $ virtualenv .venv
    $ source .venv/bin/activate

This creates a virtual environment and then activates it. If you want to exit the virtual environment, type:

    $ deactivate

### Fork / Clone the Repo

If you haven't already, clone your version of the repo:

    $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/yourusername/repo/fork

### Install Pelican & Dependancies

Use `pip` to install the list of dependencies (including Pelican) into your virtual environment:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

### Generate the Website

Now that the dependencies exists, we can build:

    $ fab build

This takes the Markdown files from the `content/` directory and generates static HTML pages inside the `output/` directory. That's it. No database required.

### Preview the Website

You can serve the generated site so it can be previewed in your browser:

    $ fab serve

And you should see the blog if you visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Blog Workflow

If you're interested in writing a blog post for the website, you need to:

- [Fork](https://github.com/amitness/amitness.github.io/fork) the repository
- Write a blog post using Markdown in the `content` directory
- Push the changes to a topic branch, like `an-example-article`, on *your* fork of the repository
- Make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) against the `source` branch


## Hosting

This blog is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) for CDN and HTTPS. A Custom domain is used. Continuous integration with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) builds the site everytime the source is updated.
